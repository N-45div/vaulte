## Overview

Vaulte is designed for Ethena x Encode Hackathon 2024, addressing critical challenges in decentralized finance. The platform enables seamless subscription payments, reinvestments of loan repayments, and collective loan pool creation, powered by **Goldsky** and **LayerZero** technologies. Vaulte provides users, merchants, and investors with tools to optimize financial transactions while maintaining transparency and efficiency.

## Problem Statement  

The lack of accessible loans for online businesses and indie hackers creates a significant hurdle for creatives and small-scale entrepreneurs. Current investment models often demand equity, leaving founders with fewer ownership rights. While platforms like indie.vc, Earnest Capital, and TinySeed exist, they primarily focus on equity-based funding. *Vaulte* seeks to solve this by offering flexible, equity-free loan solutions tailored to the needs of creatives, making repayment simple and empowering independent creators to retain full control of their ventures.

## Solution

Vaulte leverages blockchain and DeFi principles to address these challenges:  

1. **Payment Infrastructure**: Enabling seamless subscription management with transparent and low-cost transactions.  
2. **Re-Investment of Loan Repayments**: Automating the reinvestment process to maximize capital utilization.  
3. **Investor Opportunities**: Offering a USDe-backed 15% APR reinvestment option, exclusive to investors.  
4. **Loan Pools**: Allowing individuals to collectively contribute to and benefit from loan pools.  

This approach ensures accessibility, scalability, and security for all stakeholders.

## How It Works

### Key Features

- **Subscription Payments**  
  Vaulte simplifies recurring payments, offering merchants and users a robust infrastructure to manage subscriptions.

- **Reinvestment Mechanism**  
  Loan repayments are automatically reinvested, enhancing capital efficiency and reducing manual intervention.

- **Investor-Exclusive Reinvestments**  
  Investors can access a USDe-backed investment plan with a 15% APR, fostering reliable returns.

- **Loan Pools**  
  Individuals can collectively contribute to loan pools, diversifying risks and supporting small businesses.

### Workflow  

1. Users and merchants interact with Vaulteâ€™s interface (built with **Next.js**) for subscription setup and payment processing.  
2. Loan repayments are processed via smart contracts (written in **Solidity**) and reinvested automatically.  
3. Investors access exclusive financial products integrated with **Goldsky** and **LayerZero** technologies for optimized backend functionality.
